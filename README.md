# Algal-Blooms
Algal bloom is the overgrowth of microscopic algae or algal like bacteria. Algal bloom that are non- poisonous consume enormous quantum of oxygen therefore making other marine creatures to resettle or die due to lack of oxygen to survive. Blue green algae, and cyanobacteria are  a part  of  dangerous algal blooms that can impact on  health of those who consume food from these resources, submarine ecosystems, and the frugality. An algal bloom occurs when phytoplankton species reproduces at an enormous rate, multiplying in a short time. Occasionally a specie bloom at the same time. It is an photosynthetic organisms which lives suspended beneath the face of the water. To explore this, we are propose a neural network model to prognosticate the algae growth in ocean and its effect on monoculture using history available data for Muttukadu  creek, Tamil Nadu.
The  end of this study is to make use of the available MODIS data of the  once times and the affair an estimated or anticipated growth information. This data will help us to establish the rate of growth over the times. The input of the study will  correspond of image data  attained via satellite, temperature records, nutrient content record, available marine organisms record( at given time). The affair will be an approximate image of how that area is anticipated to at  named time/ time, nutrient content present, and affected organisms( if any).
